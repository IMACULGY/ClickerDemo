The program allows you to edit values for the number of clicks and the (targeted) interval between each click. You can use F7 to start the clicker, and F8 to stop it. The hotkeys will work when the program is running in the background. 

## Download Executable

You can download the executable without the source code using [this link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PVwGVkrQjZPGdzOxgfVZffhfMwv4ibES/view?usp=sharing)

Otherwise, you can get the source code from the Clone/Download drop-down or through the Releases tab.

## To-Do

- Allow users to change hotkeys to any key on the keyboard
- Change the icons, make it look "nicer"
- Add an official release to the repository so users do not have to download it externally (from Drive)
